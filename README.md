# ESP32MarauderCustom v0.13.9

This time I bring you another very interesting project with a DOIT ESP32 DevKit V1 development board. We are going to build from scratch our own version of ESP32 Marauder, a very practical portable universal tool created for Bluetooth and WiFi analysis in its b/g/n version in the 2.4GHz band. While it is true that different kits are sold on Tindie and other stores, purchasing one of these kits can be complicated for different reasons, while getting the components separately will always be easier or perhaps we already have them at home as leftovers from other projects. For these reasons, we will now look at how to create our custom version of Marauder, which would be a "Poor Manâ€™s Marauder" version.

This repository contains the modified original source code for this custom version of ESP32 Marauder built with low-cost components. As new versions of ESP32 Marauder are released I will update this repository with the modified source code for this "poor man's" version of ESP32 Marauder.
